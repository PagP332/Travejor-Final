## Travejor - Backend Developer Coding Challenge

# Goal

Build a small feature slice for traveler profiles consisting of:

1. A backend API for creating, retrieving, and updating profiles.

2. A simple web profile page that consumes the API and displays a travelerâ€™s details.

## Tech Stack

This submission was made using NextJS framework and Firestore.

The choice for NextJS was simple, it provided a simple and easy integration of both frontend and backend functionality. Because of how Next works, it has a built-in API routes that could host its own backend server, and with NextJS being implemented with ReactJS as well, could act as a full-stack framework. As well as myself having experience with using it.

For Firestore, besides it being a recommended database, Google Firebase is already the most well-known and well-documented database storage, authentication, hosting, and backend service platform. Cloud Firestore specifically is a database storage service, that uses NoSQL, which is a non-relational database. Being it the most reliable backend service as well as having experience with it myself, it was the obvious choice.

Since NextJS has Vercel hosting support, the submission itself can be previewed both offline and online.
